# VC Javascript shopping cart intergation sample
It is sample ASP NET MVC app with integrated [JS shopping cart module](https://github.com/VirtoCommerce/vc-module-javascript-shoppingcart) functionality.
Integration code example: 
 - _Layout.cshtml - required references; 
 - Index.cshml - "Buy" and "Checkout" buttons.
